Writing Documentation
=====================

This guide sets the standard to be used for documentation that exists outside
of source code. For guidance on how to document your source code, see the
:doc:`programming` and :doc:`javascript` guides. If you find that this guide
doesn't cover something, please refer to the official `reStructuredText Primer
<http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_. Better yet, improve this document  by
submitting a PR to include the missing information.
