Secure Saved Search API
=======================

The secure saved search API was developed in an attempt to utilize information
about authenticated users in regards to saving searches on the microsites. It
uses both CORS and JSONP in the similar fashion to :ref:`secure-blocks-reference`.

The Secure Saved Search API is currently used by the :ref:`saved-search-widget`.
